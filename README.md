# Advent-of-Code

These are my solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code challenge.

I'll do these initially in Python, then perhaps add other languages if I have time to redo them.

I want to give credit and appreciation to the coders of https://github.com/kodsnack/advent_of_code_2022 for giving inspiration or help where I've gotten stuck
or couldn't find an elegant solution.  Thank you!
